# Component Documentation

This project uses a feature-based documentation approach.

## Structure

- UI primitives are documented in their respective `__docs__` folders.
- Complex components should have a `.mdx` or `.stories.tsx` file (if using Storybook).

## Standards

- All components should have clear prop definitions.
- Use JSDoc for complex logic explanations.
